This is a project overview for Alternative Assessment 1: Predicting Customer Churn in E-commerce

**Project Overview: Predicting Customer Churn in E-commerce**

**1. Goals:** The primary goal of this project is to predict customer churn within an e-commerce platform using various classification models in SAS Enterprise Miner.

**2. Objectives:**
- Import the E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset into SAS Enterprise Miner, handle missing values, and specify variable roles.
- Create a decision tree model in SAS Enterprise Miner to analyze customer behavior and identify potential churn factors.
- Apply bagging and boosting techniques using the Random Forest algorithm to enhance predictive accuracy in identifying customer churn.

**3. Datasets:** E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset
The dataset offers a comprehensive view of customer behavior within an e-commerce platform, providing insights into interactions and transactions. This detailed breakdown allows for a nuanced analysis of customer preferences, engagement patterns, and satisfaction levels, facilitating data-driven decisions to enhance the overall customer experience.

**4. Software:**
In the context of the project described, SAS Enterprise Miner, Talend Data Preparation, and Talend Data Integration can play distinct roles in various stages of the data analysis and modeling process.



# Setting Up an Enterprise Miner Project
1.	Create a new SAS Enterprise Miner Project
2.	Define a new SAS library for your sample data
3.	Define a new SAS Enterprise Miner data source
4.	Create a new SAS Enterprise Miner process flow diagram
5.	Place the input data source on the process flow diagram
# Exploring Input Data and Replacing Missing Values
1.	Explore the statistical properties of the variables in the input data set.
2.	Partition the input data into Training and Test data sets.
3.	Specify how SAS Enterprise Miner should handle missing data.
# Building Decision Trees
1.	Automatically train a full decision tree and prune it to size, selecting split rules to maximize the split decision logworth.
2.	Interactively train a decision tree, and then select candidate split rules from a list.
3.	Use gradient boosting approach to form a single predictive model from a set of decision trees.
# Impute, Transform, Regression & Neural Models
1.	Impute values to use as replacements for missing values in the input data. We replace missing data because Regression and Neural Network models ignore observations that contain missing values.
2.	Transform the input variables to better suit the input data for regression analysis.
3.	Create and add a logistic model.
4.	Create and add a neural network model.
